# Individual-Self_Assessment

## Self-Assessment

- I feel very happy to work with the members of my team. Although we differ on many things, we always strive to complete this project. From the beginning, we were very worried about how we would do it, how to analyze it. But when we also discussed and divided each person's tasks, everything was completed. We all show equal commitment to our objective by taking part in deciding how work should be allocated. We are committed to helping each other learn and acknowledge good contributions from team members. Furthermore, we all turn up to meetings because we want to make sure that everyone knows whatâ€™s going on. When one of us is under pressure, others offer to help him or her.

- I really like Ayoola's way of working. He is very professional, almost every part of the project he helps people even though it is not his task. In addition, as mentioned above, my team members are all very responsible, they always complete what we discussed, and help other members. If I had to rate everyone, I'd give them all 100 because they're such amazing members

- Our challenge is perhaps time management. Everyone has different jobs and things to worry about, but we try to work things out together. Except for 2 times in class, we called to discuss on Saturday and Sunday evenings.

## Team Assessment 

- We connect with each other through many means of communication: Zoom, Google, WhatsApp, Slack. There were times when we started running the code, and we got an error, and we all had to stop to figure out what went wrong, or stop to ask TA for help. Not everything goes smoothly, but we are always trying to get better.
> Some tips for effective teamwork
- It is necessary to divide the work for each person and set deadlines for them. You can ask each other if anyone needs help.

## Summary of Project 

- The topic is **PREDICTING IMDb RATINGS**

- We use several ML in this project : 
> 1. Multiple linear Regression : Best Score : 0.244
> 2. Support Vector Machine. Accuracy : 0.86
> 3. Random Forest Regression Best Score : 0.4961116558077189
> 4. Gradient Boosting Accuracy : 0.98
> 5. Deep Learning

- We use machine learning algorithms that can predict the IMDb rating based on the features. To achieve this from Various Models, the model with the lowest root mean squared error, the best accuracy, and best confusion matrix is selected.
